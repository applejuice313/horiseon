# module-1-code-refactor-horiseon

This module is an exercise in refactoring code as per client specifications.  Code for a company named "Horiseon Social Services" was provided to me in order to further develop it in order to meet the following criteria:

when the client inspects the html:

*html includes semantic elements which follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
*images within html contain associated alt attributes
*all heading attributes fall in a sequential order
*title is concise and descriptive
